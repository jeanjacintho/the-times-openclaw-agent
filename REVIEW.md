# Review instructions — the-times-openclaw-agent

Repo-specific reviewer policy. The universal voice posture (Broken-Glass,
pro-simplification, and the don't-propose list) is supplied by the reviewers
themselves and is deliberately not restated here.

## What this repo is

**One agent**: The Times on OpenClaw. It is a personal newspaper (agenda,
weather, sports scores and the news the owner asked for) researched on the
owner's Mac and printed there, or sent as a PDF in chat. The advisor's desk
moved to `jeanjacintho/the-founder-memo-openclaw-agent`; it does not come back
here. This repo is the prompt, the `pt-*` skills and their scripts, a plugin,
and its own `boot/`, built directly on the upstream OpenClaw image rather than
on `plow-pbc/plow-openclaw-agent`. `README.md` owns
the product prose and this file does not repeat it. Flag drift between that
prose and the code, in either direction.

**Operating point:** pre-PMF, a handful of installs, each one owner's paper
running in Docker against their own Plow line. One owner, one container, one
paper a day: there is no shared state, no concurrency between owners and no
scale to design for. So the dominant lens is **YAGNI**. Decline remedies that
add retries, fallbacks, locks, caches, multi-tenant or concurrency guards, or
abstractions for a second caller that does not exist; prefer the deletion or
the inline version. A finding must name what breaks for one owner's paper
today. A reliability guess about load this repo will not see is at most
`[low]`.

**Security findings name a reachable loss.** The owner trusts their own
agent. "A prompt-injected or misbehaving agent could do X with the owner's
own data" is not blocking unless X reaches another person, spends money, or
moves the owner's data out of their Mac and chat. Before labeling a finding
`[blocking] security`, state the concrete loss if it fired today; without one
it is at most `[low]`, worded as a question. Do not prescribe sandboxes,
allowlists or validation layers for threats this operating point does not
face.

**The one carve-out is the owner's data.** The agent holds that owner's
credential and reaches their mail, calendar, browser and printer through
Latch, so a credential, a chat id, an account name or a real person's data
anywhere in the tracked tree is blocking. That includes the edition renders
under `index/`, which are drawn from synthetic data.

Skills, prompts and comments are in English. The paper is written in the
owner's language, which `pt-intake` records. Owner-facing text that hard-codes
a language around that is a finding.

## Review priority

Subtractive remedies outrank additive ones. Three gates here can be checked
directly, and they come ahead of anything else:

- **It reports. It does not act, and it does not invent.** The paper makes no
  purchases, bookings, logins or downloads, and every claim carries a source.
  Block a change that lets a skill act on what it reads, or that turns a
  failed read into content (an empty agenda, a clear inbox, a paragraph with
  no page behind it). A failed read has to reach the page as a failure.
- **Pins are the supply chain.** The OpenClaw `FROM` carries a digest. The
  Agent Index client is fetched by commit sha and checked by sha256. uv
  (by sha256), WeasyPrint, pydyf and PyYAML are exact versions. Block a move
  to a mutable ref. Bumping a pin to a new immutable revision is ordinary
  work, not a finding.
- **`boot/` does not grow a second base.** Identity, the MCP bridge, the
  Agent Index reporter and the model wiring are what `plow-openclaw-agent`
  provides to every other OpenClaw variant. A fix there belongs in the base
  first. New boot logic the base already has is a finding, and the remedy is
  to delete it, not to keep both in sync.

**Repo-specific contrast pairs:**

| Variant DON'T (suppress / flag-as-shape) | Variant DO (real finding) |
|---|---|
| Flag a section, a default, a team followed or a news topic for being **specific to one owner's paper**. Being one person's paper is the reason this repo exists. Generality here is bloat, not a fix. | Flag a change that a **sibling repo owns**. Research, mail, calendar and print go through Latch's tools and the gog grammar. The paper's wiki pages follow `plow-wiki`'s schema and CLI. The usage reporter is `agent-index-client`, which this repo only pins. Account, login, mint and revoke belong to `plow-agents`. The test: who else would have to change if this fact changed? |

**Update cadence:** edit this when the operating point moves. Product and architecture
edits belong in `README.md`, not here.
