-- The Times calendar desk. Copy this file VERBATIM into
-- plow_run_applescript (app: "Calendar"). Do not rewrite it.
--
-- Measured live 2026-09-18 on the owner's Mac:
--   1. Querying Calendar.app while it is closed returns
--      "Application isn't running" (-600) and the desk wrote an empty day.
--      Measured again 2026-09-25: `launch` from this runner returns -600 too,
--      so the desk opens Calendar with plow_run_command `open -g -a Calendar`
--      first (desks.md); this script only waits for it to settle.
--   2. Asking Calendar for "the time string of the first event of the
--      first calendar in one whose-clause" returns -1700 (Can't make
--      that into a type specifier). Walk each calendar, then each event
--      in a `whose` range, then read properties of THAT event.
--   3. A locale English date literal is fragile. Build the window from
--      `current date` with time set to 0.
--   4. No `try`: a swallowed calendar error printed EMPTY, which reads as a
--      free day. An error fails the call so the desk says it could not read.
