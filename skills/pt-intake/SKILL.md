name: pt-intake
description: Classify a chat message into a research topic — new topic or status question, and which of the four shapes it is (one-off, subscription, section, assignment) and depth (quick/deep) — write it to pt/topics.json via the topics script, and schedule the run that will produce its edition. Use on every owner chat turn that is not a status question. Status questions (list my topics, list my papers, stop watching X, cancel a dated item, when will it land, add/remove a second daily delivery time, a newspaper at another hour) are answered from the files, not this skill's scheduling path. Never research inside the turn.

# pt-intake — a chat message becomes a scheduled research job

You classify; a later session researches. The turn's job is: classify,
write, schedule, confirm with a time. Nothing more.

## Read the state first, every turn

Two local files, both cheap:

- `/var/lib/plow/pt/topics.json` — run `topics.py list` for the readable form
- `/var/lib/plow/pt/config.json` — delivery preferences (run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-shared/scripts/pt_config_gate.py` on it if it looks wrong)

Answer status questions from these files, never from
session memory — another session may have delivered since yours started.

Keep `owner.language` current before classifying, per SOUL.md
(`record_owner_language.py`; a scheduled edition has no live message to
read a language from). It is not a confirmation to ask about and not a
change to narrate.

## Optional departments and sports

For "add weather", "remove my agenda" or "include my emails", use
`/opt/plow/skills/pt-shared/scripts/set_desks.py <weather|calendar|mail> <on|off>`.
A missing switch means off. Never make these choices into news topics or
restart setup. Read the result and confirm the chosen department. Removing
mail stops both mailbox reads and inclusion in the PDF.

For "follow NFL", "all NBA games" or "Brasileirão scores", use
`/opt/plow/skills/pt-shared/scripts/set_sports.py add-league "<name>" <league>`;
for "stop NFL", use `set_sports.py remove-league <league>`. Use `nfl`, `nba`,
`bra.1` when known; confirm an unfamiliar ESPN slug in the Mac browser and ask
which competition when ambiguous. Never silently route a league into a generic
news topic. `set_sports.py list` lists both teams and leagues. At most five
teams and five leagues; a team and its league share one scoreboard gather.

## Status questions — answer from the file, then stop

These are ordinary turns, not classifications. Do them and end:

- **"what are you watching" / "list my topics"** — run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-intake/scripts/topics.py list` and render it as a short list:
  each active topic, its kind, when its edition last landed.
- **"list my paper" / "what's in my paper" / "list my papers"** — run
  `topics.py list` and group by paper, on pt-research's rosters: the main
  paper first (hour from `delivery.hour`: standing desks, its sections,
  pending assignments), then one block per other `deliver_at` hour with its
  sections. Extra reprint times
  (`delivery.extra_hours`) are the same main paper again, not a different
  roster — mention them as extra arrivals of the main paper.
- **"stop watching X" / "drop X from my paper"** — resolve X against the
  active topics; if ambiguous, ask which one and stop. Then
  `topics.py cancel <id>`, and immediately run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-dashboard/scripts/register_crons.py` so the nightly job is
  removed now rather than at the next bring-up. Confirm in one line.
- **"cancel what I asked for in tomorrow's paper"** — resolve against pending
  `assignment` topics and `topics.py cancel <id>`. A delivered assignment is
  terminal; say so rather than pretending to cancel it.
- **"when will it land" / "did it come?"** — read the topic's `status` and
  `scheduled_for` / `run_on` / `last_edition_at` and answer. A missing
  edition in this session's history is not evidence it never landed.
- **"I want the paper twice a day" / "send it at 10:30 too" / "drop the
  second edition"** — a second (or third) full-paper delivery time is not a
  topic, so it never goes through `topics.py`: it is `delivery.extra_hours`
  in `pt/config.json`, a list of "HH:MM" strings alongside `delivery.hour`,
  in the owner's own clock like it. Append (or remove) the time they name
  in `extra_hours`, validate with
  `pt_config_gate.py`, paste its output, then re-run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-dashboard/scripts/register_crons.py` so
  `pt-daily-edition-2` (or `-3`, numbered by list order) exists or is
  removed **now** — never a hand-registered cron (see `pt-dashboard`).
  Confirm in one line, in the owner's own terms —
  "got it, the paper now arrives at 03:00 and 10:30" — never mention the
  container's zone.
- **"I want a newspaper about X at 12:00" / "another paper at 18:00 with
  Y" / "put Z in the noon paper"** — this is **not** `extra_hours`. It is a
  `section` with `--deliver-at HH:MM` (the owner's own clock, like
  `delivery.hour`). Sections that share an hour share one paper;
  a different hour is a different paper (`pt-paper-HHMM`):

      topics.py add --text "<topic>" --kind section --depth quick --deliver-at HH:MM

  If `deliver_at` equals `delivery.hour`, omit `--deliver-at` — it rides
  the main paper. Count news items **per paper** (max 3 on that hour's
  roster, standing desks do not count). Then run `register_crons.py` so
  `pt-paper-HHMM` exists now. Confirm in the owner's terms: "you'll get a
  sports paper at 12:00".
- **"drop the 18:00 paper" / "cancel the noon newspaper"** — resolve against
  active sections with that `deliver_at`; `topics.py cancel` each, then
  `register_crons.py` so the `pt-paper-*` job is swept. Confirm in one line.
  Dropping one section from a multi-section paper is "stop watching X",
  not dropping the whole paper.
- **"put my mail in the paper" / "drop the letters column"** — `mail.configured`
  in `pt/config.json`. Probe through Latch before writing true, **Google
  (`plow-gog gmail search`) first, Mail.app only if that fails** (same
  argv order as pt-setup). Validate with the gate, then confirm in one line.
  The daily job already exists; no extra cron.
- **"put Flamengo's score in my paper" / "follow the Lakers" / "stop the Lakers"** — the
  sports desk, not a topic. `/opt/plow/skills/pt-shared/scripts/set_sports.py add "<team>"
  <league>` (the ESPN league slug: `bra.1` Brasileirão, `nba`, `nfl`, `eng.1`, `esp.1` …;
  desks.md §4 confirms it at run time) or `set_sports.py remove "<team>"`; `set_sports.py
  list` answers "which teams do you follow". It refuses a sixth team: say the cap in one line.
  Confirm in one line. The daily job already exists; no extra cron. A sport or league with
  no team ("football news") is a news section, below.

## New topic — classify, then write

Decide, in this order:

**1. Is this a topic at all?** A greeting, a question about the agent, a complaint
about an edition — none of these is a topic. Answer it like a person and
stop. A question the OWNER wants researched is a topic only when the
answer must be *looked up* on the web, not when it's something you know
or can say in a line.

**2. Which of the four shapes is it?**

| The owner says | Shape | What it becomes |
|---|---|---|
| "my paper should have X" / "X in the paper every day" | `section` | a fixed block in the **main** daily paper (no `deliver_at`) |
| "a paper about X at 12:00" / "Y in the noon newspaper" | `section` with `--deliver-at` | a block in that hour's paper, not the main one |
| "X in tomorrow's paper" / "Y in Friday's paper" | `assignment` | one research pass whose result appears **only** in that day's paper |
| "research X, tell me later" | `one_off` | its own edition, delivered once |
| "update me on Y every night" / "keep an eye on Z" | `subscription` | its own edition, re-run on the delivery hour |
| "send me the paper now" / "generate a copy I can read right now" | **not a topic** | queue the daily edition now — see below |

**"Give me a copy of my paper" is not a subject to research.** It names no
claim to look up; it asks you to run the paper the owner already
configured, now instead of at the delivery hour. Filed as a topic, it
becomes an edition *about the phrase*, carrying none of their sections.
Do not add a topic.

Queue it with `register_crons.py --now`, which `pt-edition` documents
under **On demand**; the paper arrives as its own message. If the output
has a `queued:` line, reply with one ⏳ line in `owner.language` saying it
is on its way; name anything else the output reports failing (a paused
job, say) in one more line. An `already running:` line means a copy is
mid-paper and no second one was queued: say in one ⏳ line that the edition
already in progress is on its way. With neither line, say it could not be
queued. Never research or render it in this turn.

A subscription/section is anything with a cadence in it. A one-off/assignment
is a single ask. When the owner genuinely cannot be read as one or the other,
ask — one question, then classify their answer. Do not silently guess a
cadence into someone's mornings.

**3. Quick or deep?** The clock decides the default: a topic asked during the
owner's waking day is `quick`; a topic asked late at night, anything they
said to "keep an eye on", and every subscription's nightly run is `deep`.
**Sections are always `quick`** — several sections at deep would blow any
delivery lead, so depth there is not offered. Assignments default `quick`; an
explicit "properly" / "deep dive" can raise them. An explicit "quick, one
line" lowers anything.

Two rules that keep the paper honest:

- **Dedup.** Resolve the new ask against what already exists. "My paper
  should have weather" → use `set_desks.py weather on`, not a news section
  that would search the forecast twice. Same for calendar and mail. "My paper
  should have the dollar" when a dollar section is already active → point at
  the existing one. An assignment whose subject matches a section → one
  question: "every day, or only in tomorrow's paper?".
- **Each paper holds at most 3 news items total.** Weather and the single
  calendar rail do not count against it. Count standing sections plus any
  assignments due in the main paper. Sections at a different `deliver_at`
  have their own three-item roster; unscoped sections and sections explicitly
  set to the main `delivery.hour` share one roster. If another item would
  exceed three, refuse with the full roster and ask which one to drop.

Then write it — this script is the ONLY writer for topics.json:

    /opt/plow/skills/pt-intake/scripts/topics.py add --text "<the topic, in the owner's words>" --kind one_off|subscription|section|assignment --depth quick|deep [--run-on YYYY-MM-DD] [--deliver-at HH:MM] [--scheduled-for <ISO-8601 with offset; required for one_off>]

Adding a `section` the owner already has is a no-op: the script prints
`{"duplicate_of": "<id>", ...}` and adds nothing, because a section is an
evergreen standing interest, not a second beat. That output is a success,
not an error — do not retry it with different wording to force a second
copy. One-offs and assignments are never collapsed; "research X again" is
a real second request.

`--run-on` is required for an assignment and refused for every other kind.
`--deliver-at` is section-only: the owner's own `HH:MM` for a paper other
than the main daily edition. Omit it for the main paper. Compute "tomorrow"/"Friday" as a real calendar date in **the owner's timezone**
(the one in `pt/config.json`), never from the container's clock reading past
midnight. If the day is ambiguous ("the 15th", "next Friday"), ask — never
guess a date onto a promise. Paste the script's output; the `id` it prints is
the topic's identity everywhere else.

## Schedule the run — one-time crons, never inline

Every stored hour is the owner's own clock; `register_crons.py` (spec in
`pt-dashboard`) derives every job from the topic store.

- **Section** — nothing to schedule by hand: write the topic (with
  `--deliver-at` when it belongs to a non-main paper), then run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-dashboard/scripts/register_crons.py` so
  `pt-daily-edition` or `pt-paper-HHMM` is created (or its schedule
  reconciled) **now**, not at the next bring-up.
  Paste the script's output and report its exit status.
- **Assignment** — **never gets a cron of its own**: it rides the daily
  edition. The daily job exists because the assignment is pending (the
  registration you run after writing it sees that). Confirm with the *real*
  date it will appear: if the target day's edition has already left by the
  time the owner asks, the assignment lands in the next one — say so, and
  remember the late tag follows it.
- **One-off** — pick the moment: quick is now+3m; deep is the next
  `delivery.hour` from pt/config.json, in the owner's zone (today if it has
  not passed, tomorrow otherwise), so the result lands with the morning
  paper. Record it at add time as an ISO-8601 instant with the owner's
  offset via `--scheduled-for`, then run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-dashboard/scripts/register_crons.py`. It
  creates `pt-oneoff-<id>` at that `scheduled_for` with the topic's own
  prompt and the deliver target baked in; the sweep removes it once the
  topic is delivered.
- **Subscription** — write the topic, then run
  `/opt/plow/skills/pt-dashboard/scripts/register_crons.py` so `pt-subscription-<id>`
  exists now.

If `register_crons.py` fails, say so — a topic
whose run was never scheduled is a promise with no paper behind it, and the
owner must hear it rather than wait for an edition that will never come.

## Confirm, in one line

The turn's final response is CHAT_VOICE: 📰 then a space, then one spoken
line with a time — not a progress report.

Portuguese examples:

> 📰 Beleza — um jornal sobre <assunto> cai aqui em uns 3 minutos.
> 📰 Todo dia de manhã, às 7h, isso entra no jornal.
> 📰 O preço do iPhone vai no jornal de sexta.

English examples:

> 📰 On it — a paper on <topic> lands here in about 3 minutes.
> 📰 You'll get that every morning at 7:00.
> 📰 The iPhone price goes in Friday's paper.

Never narrate the mechanics (no "writing topics.json", no "scheduling a cron").
The edition, when it lands, speaks for itself.

## Never mark a topic yourself

`post_to_chat.py` finalizes the topics an edition carried, after its POST
succeeds (`pt-edition` step 3). Never mark a topic delivered in the intake
turn — nothing has been delivered yet.
