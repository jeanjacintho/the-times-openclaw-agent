"""finalize_setup.py -- the ONLY way pt-setup writes pt/config.json.

Measured live (2026-09-16): the close step said "**Write**
/var/lib/plow/pt/config.json from the draft plus those two fields" and
named no command, and nothing in the tree wrote that file. The run had
everything it needed -- printer probed through the AppleScript fallback,
timezone read from the browser, topics saved -- then ran pt_config_gate.py
against a file nobody had created. The gate collapses OSError into "not
valid JSON", so a MISSING file reported as a corrupt one, and the owner was
told the setup "hit a configuration error". Nothing was wrong with the data.

This script is the fix, the same shape record_setup.py is for the draft:
one named command that owns the file, so the close step never has to
improvise a write. It reads the draft, writes the config, and validates it -- refusing, without leaving a partial file behind, rather
than writing something the gate would reject.

Usage:

    finalize_setup.py <config.json path> --owner-tz <IANA zone>

The zone is step 1's answer (from the browser). The hour is the draft's, the
owner's own wall clock; register_crons.py moves it onto the container's
clock when it registers. Prints CONFIG:written
plus the delivery line on success; on failure prints why, on stderr, and
writes nothing.
