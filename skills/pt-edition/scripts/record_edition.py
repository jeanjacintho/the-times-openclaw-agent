"""record_edition.py -- put a delivered edition into the owner's wiki.

usage: record_edition.py <run/<id>/edition.json>

Run once the chat leg is out (pt-edition), never before: the wiki records what
the owner received. The day's page is projects/thetimes/editions/<date>.md;
each edition that day appends one `## HH:MM edition` block, stamped in the
owner's own zone (`owner_time.owner_now()`), never the container's: the
advisor's card, then every section the owner chose (anything with a
topic_id) with its body, the evidence its research notes hold
(run/<topic_id>/notes.json) and what could not be sourced. Weather,
calendar, mail and sports stay out: they are the day's reads of the owner's
own accounts, and the wiki is every agent's recall.

The page's `priority` frontmatter is the card of the day's chronologically
latest edition (by its own `HH:MM`, not by write order -- two papers can
record out of order, and the earlier one finishing second must not overwrite
a later card with an older one; `priority_at` is that edition's timestamp,
kept only to judge the next write). Its `sections` frontmatter is each topic
id's own record (headline and every sourced claim), merged across the day's
editions. `updated` is monotonic for the same reason: an edition recording
out of order must not move it backward and have the page announce an older
update than the write that already landed. history.py reads both `priority`
and `sections` back as history. After the write, `wiki
validate` and `wiki index`, so the paper's page lists the day.

The renderer already refused a malformed edition.json before delivery, so the
fields it requires are read directly.

Every string that came from research is untrusted, and Obsidian renders the
page's Markdown and HTML on the owner's Mac: an image link is fetched on open,
a forged heading or list item reads as the paper's own. So each one is written
through `_md()` (inline syntax, and line starts, made inert) and each link
through `_url()` (http(s) only) -- the same once-in-code escaping
render_edition.py does for the printed page.

Prints `RECORDED <page>` or `SKIPPED: <why>`. A failure exits non-zero with
`error: edition not recorded — <why>`; the delivery it follows still stands.
