"""history.py -- what this paper printed on recent days, from the wiki.

usage: history.py recent [--topic <topic_id>]

Prints JSON, oldest first, reading the edition pages record_edition.py writes
(projects/thetimes/editions/<date>.md). Bare, it is the advisor's desk's
own history: [{"date", "desk"}], the `priority` card each of the 7 days
before today carries. With `--topic`, it is one news section's:
[{"date", "headline", "printed": [{"claim", "url"}]}], what record_edition.py
recorded under that topic id in the page's frontmatter, for today and the 7
days before it -- so the next pass knows which sources it has already
spent and which claims it has already made -- a section with no memory
reprints the same story every morning (issue #69).
The two windows differ on purpose. Today's own page is never the desk's
history: a second edition the same date would otherwise read the first
back as "yesterday". A topic's window reaches through today instead: the
pass most likely to reprint this morning's section is an afternoon focused
paper or a live copy later the same day, and today's page is exactly where
that repeat would be caught.
record_edition.py writes those pages only once a paper was delivered, so a card
the owner never received is never history. A day with no page, or no card, is
left out. When the Mac does not answer: `error: history unavailable — <why>`,
non-zero; the desk then writes only its stub and stops (`pt-priority/SKILL.md`).

"Today" is the owner's own day (`owner_time.owner_today()`), not the
container's -- see that module's docstring for why, and for the same
`error: history unavailable — <why>` refusal on a config that can't be
trusted rather than a guessed window.
