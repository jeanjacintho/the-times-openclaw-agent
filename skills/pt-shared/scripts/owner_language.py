Not a flow script: a library the pt-* scripts import. `record_owner_language.py`
writes `owner.language`; this reads it, for the mechanical lines that are
repo-authored copy rather than model prose (the chat wait lines, the
print-miss line, the page's date line).

One predicate, so `pt-PT`, `pt_AO` and `pt-BR` owners all get the same
Portuguese copy from the same config value.
