"""record_setup.py -- the ONLY way pt-setup writes .setup-draft.json.

Measured live (2026-09-14): after the owner accepted the default hour, the
model wrote the draft itself with a free-form `write_file` call, then went
on -- same turn -- to probe the printer through Latch and ask about the
letters desk, all before the owner ever saw "is a printer set up on your
Mac?" as its own question. The draft never got a `printer` key at all: the
probe's answer was used to phrase a reply and then dropped. Prose telling
the model "ask one question, then stop" was not enough to stop that.

This script is the fix: pt-setup never hand-edits .setup-draft.json again.
Every answer is recorded here, and the script -- not the model's own
judgement -- says what to ask next.

Usage:

    record_setup.py <config.json path> key=value [key=value ...]
    record_setup.py <config.json path> --done

`--done` is the close step's last act: it deletes the draft and prints
DRAFT:cleared. It is idempotent (an already-deleted draft is success) and it
REFUSES a draft whose interview is unfinished, naming what is still missing --
the draft is the only record of how far setup got, and a wrong delete re-asks
the owner everything.

Each `key` is a dot-path merged into `.setup-draft.json` (a sibling file of
<config.json path>); a key with no dot is a top-level field. "true"/"false"
(any case) parse as booleans, everything else is kept as a string -- so
"07:00" is written as the string "07:00", and "true"/"false" for
printer.configured / priority.configured / mail.configured are real JSON booleans, not the
strings "true"/"false" (the gate and setup_needed.py's draft_line both
require isinstance(..., bool)).

A value containing a space needs its own shell quoting, same as any other
command argument -- e.g. printer.name="HP LaserJet 4" -- nothing here reads
JSON off argv, so there is no `{`/`}`/inner-quote escaping to get wrong.

Prints two lines on success:

    DRAFT:<comma-joined fields already recorded, or "none">
    NEXT_QUESTION=<hour|printer|priority|mail|news|close>

pt-setup's SKILL.md reads NEXT_QUESTION to decide what to ask -- never by
re-deriving "what's next" from the draft's shape itself, and never from
what the chat thread already discussed. Ask exactly that one thing, then
stop; do not also perform the step after it in the same reply.

Exit 0 on success. A malformed key=value pair, or a draft file that isn't a
JSON object, is a named failure on stderr, exit 1 -- still a bare script
invocation with no interpreter wrapping, so SOUL.md's script-execution gate
stays satisfied even when this fails.
