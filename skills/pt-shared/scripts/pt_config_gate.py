"""Shared structural gate for the pt-config (the Times' pt/config.json).

This is the SINGLE shared definition of "installed" for the pt-config. It runs
in the agent container, invoked as:

    python3 .../pt-shared/scripts/pt_config_gate.py <config.json>

at setup time (after pt-setup writes the config) and before anything schedules
against it, so the structural contract lives in one place, single-homed with
references/config.example.json, and no caller can drift from it.

Output contract (the ld_config_gate.py shape, minus the jq-equivalence
requirement this repo does not carry):
  - Prints the failing invariant name(s) to stdout, joined by "; ".
  - Empty stdout == PASS. Never prints anything else on pass.
  - Prints exactly "not valid JSON" (and nothing else) when the file does not
    parse as JSON, is unreadable, or has a shape the checks themselves could
    not inspect (indexing a non-object, testing a non-string).
  - Never prints PII. There is none by design: the config holds a timezone, a
    delivery hour, and whether a printer exists.

The ten checks:
  1. owner.timezone must contain a non-whitespace char. register_crons.py
     refuses to register unless the container's TZ equals it, and SOUL.md
     routes first-run onboarding from the keys' presence -- a blank one
     satisfies neither.
  2. delivery.hour must be the exact "HH:MM" shape (00-23 : 00-59). The cron
     spec is built as "<minute> <hour> * * *" from both parts -- a bare cron
     expression is already minute-precise (the lead-time subtraction for the
     daily paper has always produced a non-zero minute field), so any real
     "HH:MM" is a real promise the schedule can keep; only the shape itself
     is refused here.
  3. printer.configured must be a boolean. It is the print path's only gate,
     so a truthy string ("false" reads truthy) would hand pt-print a printer
     that does not exist -- a print leg that fails on every nightly run.
  4. printer.name must be a non-blank string when configured is true: `lp -d`
     needs a destination. When configured is false, name may be null or
     absent.
  5. delivery.lead_minutes, when present, is a non-negative integer: it is how many
     minutes before delivery.hour the daily paper's run starts, and a bool
     (True is an int in Python), a string, or a negative would not be a
     number of minutes. How far back is too far is register_crons.py's call:
     daily_schedule() refuses a run before midnight of its day. Absent
     is valid -- readers default it to 0, so an install written before the
     key existed does not start failing this gate.
  6. delivery.extra_hours, when present, is a list of "HH:MM" strings: one
     more full-paper delivery time the same day (register_crons.py registers
     one job per entry, numbered pt-daily-edition-2, -3, ...). Absent is
     valid -- one delivery a day is the common case.
  7. owner.language, when present, is a non-blank string: the language the
     owner writes to this agent in, plain-English name ("Portuguese",
     "Mandarin Chinese"), kept current by pt-intake on every turn so a
     scheduled edition -- which has no live message to detect a language
     from -- still writes in whatever the owner most recently used. Absent
     is valid: an install that predates this field, or one where the owner
     has only ever written in one language pt-intake hasn't needed to
     record yet, defaults elsewhere (pt-edition) rather than failing here.
  8. mail.configured, when the mail object is present, must be a boolean.
     Absent mail is valid and means the letters desk is off -- this agent
     does not invent an inbox. True means the daily paper reads today's
     mail through Latch (Gmail via plow-gog first, Mail.app if that fails);
     false is an explicit no.
  9. no string value anywhere may be a leftover [UPPER_SNAKE] placeholder.
  10. priority, when present, has a boolean `configured`. Absent priority
     is valid and means the desk is off.

The owner's name, location, or any other personal fact is deliberately not
among the checks, and not in the schema: location is fetched each run via
Latch and printed that day, never stored here. The durable record is still
the topics, these delivery preferences, language, and whether mail is on.
