"""post_to_chat.py -- the edition's chat leg: POST the PDF (or, if none, the
chat text) to the owner's home channel over the Plow Chat API, directly,
with no dependency on a connected live platform adapter.

Originally the fallback for a run with no --deliver arm. Promoted to the
PRIMARY chat leg (not a fallback) after measuring cron/scheduler.py's own
delivery live: the same unchanged content, run to run, both delivered fine
via --deliver and was silently discarded with "Fire claim ownership lost;
stale result was discarded" -- a genuine intermittent race in the previous
runtime's cron heartbeat/claim mechanism, not anything about this script's content.
Calling the Plow Chat REST API directly, the same three calls
plow-chat-platform's own adapter makes internally (declare an attachment,
PUT the bytes to its signed upload_url, POST the message with
attachment_uids), needs no live adapter and is not subject to that race --
it is a plain HTTP call that either succeeds or exits loudly, same as the
text-only POST below always was.

Text is read from ``--text-file`` when provided, otherwise from STDIN only
when there is no PDF. With ``--pdf``, ``--text-file`` is reserved for the
small mail companion omitted from the printed page; without it the
message is attachment-only. The full chat transcript is never a caption.
Omit ``--pdf`` to post text only (the fallback when weasyprint could not
write the file).

The endpoint and credential come
from the process environment alone (PLOW_API_BASE, PLOW_HOME_CHANNEL,
PLOW_AGENT_TOKEN), which first boot publishes from the credential the host
dropped in: a file the agent can write is not a place to look for the API
base its own bearer is sent to. Any of the three unset or blank is refused
BY NAME, before anything posts, so a half-delivered run cannot happen.

`--pdf PATH` attaches that file (declare -> upload -> message-with-
attachment_uids) and optionally sends the companion as its body.
`--hold-until HH:MM` is a scheduled paper's send clock, on the owner's
clock. If that hour has passed it posts now. If it is still ahead, nothing
waits in the session (OpenClaw's exec is synchronous with a 30-minute
ceiling, and a paper starts up to 150 minutes early): the PDF, companion or
text, `edition.json` and each news section's notes are copied into
`pt/outbox/<date>-<HHMM>/` with a `delivery.json`, it prints `held for HH:MM
— pt-deliver posts it` and exits 0. The no-agent `pt-deliver` job runs
`post_to_chat.py --flush-outbox` every minute and posts each entry once its
hour has come, through the same delivery as the direct path. Without a
registered, enabled `pt-deliver` the paper posts now -- early, never stranded.
After the POST returns, a separate recovery ticket snapshots the edition and
the pending finalizers before they run. `pt-deliver` resumes that ticket without
posting the edition again, then removes it when every finalizer completes.
After a successful POST, three
finalizers run independently and best-effort: finalize exactly the topics carried by
`edition.json`, print the run's PDF via print_edition.py when configured (a
miss posts one line saying why), and record via
record_edition.py (`--pdf` and `--text-file` both) on the sibling
`edition.json` -- one's failure never skips or undoes another, and nothing
about the record reaches chat. `--dry-run` prints the redacted envelope and
never sends.
