"""wiki_setup.py -- make the owner's wiki ready for The Times.

usage: wiki_setup.py [--desk]

Idempotent and cheap when there is nothing to do (a few page reads), so every
caller runs it: pt-setup when the advisor's desk is turned on, the desk before
each daily pass (--desk), and record_edition.py before it writes.

  - no ~/Plow/wiki          -> `wiki init ~/Plow/wiki` through Latch's plugin
  - an install from before the rename, with projects/theplowtimes declared
    and projects/thetimes not yet: every page the wiki's index lists under
    the old root is copied to the new one once, its links rewritten. The old
    folder and its wiki.toml entry stay as they were; nothing reads them after.
  - the paper's schema and page, when absent, from pt-shared/assets/wiki/
  - with --desk: entities/owner/goals.md and projects/thetimes/qa.md, when
    absent. An install from before the wiki carries the body of
    ~/Plow/prioritization.md over once (the old file stays; it is the owner's).
  - projects/thetimes declared in wiki.toml, when its parsed roots lack it
    (whatever spelling declares them), appended last so a run that failed
    halfway runs again; no other line of the file is touched.

Prints WIKI:ready or `WIKI:set up <what>`. Any failure exits non-zero with
`error: wiki not ready — <why>`.
