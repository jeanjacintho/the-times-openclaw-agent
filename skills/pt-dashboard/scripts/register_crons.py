"""Register the Times' crons, idempotently, from the topic store.

Why this exists at all. The scheduler keeps its jobs in the gateway's state
volume; a fresh volume has none, and nothing else replays them. Keeping the
spec here, derived from pt/topics.json (the one record of what the owner
asked to be watched), means "set up the plow times crons" replays a reviewed
derivation instead of improvising schedules from a sentence. The spec is
data-driven rather than fixed: the topic list changes.

The spec (design doc §3.6 and the personalized-paper plan §3.3/§6):

  pt-daily-edition       <min> <hour> * * *        one job; exists while
                         computed as                setup can register
                         delivery.hour -
                         lead_minutes (never
                         before midnight)
  pt-daily-edition-<n>   same, extra_hours         reprint of the MAIN paper
                         (n ≥ 2)                    (unscoped sections), not
                                                    a different roster
  pt-paper-HHMM          same computation          one job per distinct
                         against a section's        section deliver_at that
                         deliver_at                 is not delivery.hour
  pt-subscription-<id>   0 <delivery.hour> * * *   one per subscription topic
                                                   not yet cancelled
  pt-oneoff-<id>         one-shot at the topic's   one per pending one-off
                         scheduled_for             still ahead; swept once
                                                   delivered
  pt-daily-edition-now   one-shot, a minute out    --now: the main paper on
                                                   demand, same prompt, no hold

Every cron job is registered with `--tz owner.timezone`: every stored hour --
delivery.hour, extra_hours, a section's deliver_at -- is the owner's wall
clock, and the scheduler fires on it directly, daylight saving included.
post_to_chat.py's --hold-until waits on the same zone. Each job is an agent
turn in an isolated session with delivery `none`; the paper reaches chat
through post_to_chat.py.

This script therefore CREATES missing jobs and REMOVES pt-* jobs whose
topic is gone -- cancelled, delivered one-offs, or names with no topic
behind them. It never touches a job whose name does not start with pt-:
those are not this agent's to manage (OpenClaw keeps its own jobs, such as
its heartbeat, in the same list).

It also RECONCILES drift, which create-if-missing alone does not: a job
that is registered with a different schedule, zone, prompt or model than
the spec calls for is updated in place with `cron edit`. Drift is only
judged on a field the scheduler reported; a missing field is left alone
rather than edited on a guess. Never remove-then-create a drifted job: if
create failed after remove, the morning paper had no job until someone
reran the script.

One refusal is the point of the script: an unreadable, partial or
unexpected job listing aborts. Never read "I could not tell what is
registered" as "nothing is" -- that re-registers every job and duplicates
all of them.

It runs INSIDE the container, from a turn: exec inherits the gateway token
the scheduler CLI needs.
